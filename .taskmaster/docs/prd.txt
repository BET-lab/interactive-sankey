# Interactive Sankey Diagram Visualization Project

## Project Overview
Create an interactive Sankey diagram visualization as a single HTML file using D3.js library. The diagram will show flow relationships between nodes with interactive features and customizable styling.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Technical Architecture
- Single HTML file containing all code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Use D3.js library for visualization
- Read data from local JSON file
- No external server dependencies required

### 2. Data Structure
- Define JSON format for Sankey diagram data
- Support nodes and links structure
- Include metadata for styling and customization
- Local file-based data loading

### 3. Visual Design
- Based on reference.png design
- Nodes with SVG icons (placeholder SVG initially)
- Gradient colors for flow ribbons between nodes
- Modern, clean UI design
- Responsive layout

### 4. Interactive Features
- Progressive disclosure: Initially show only leftmost nodes
- Other nodes hidden or highly transparent
- Click interaction on nodes to reveal connected nodes and flows
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Expandable navigation through node hierarchy

### 5. Customization Features
- Configurable node styles (colors, sizes, shapes)
- Customizable ribbon/flow colors and gradients
- Adjustable layout parameters
- Flexible styling options

### 6. User Experience
- Intuitive click-to-explore navigation
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Professional appearance

## Technical Specifications

### Data Format
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "name": "Node Name",
      "level": 0,
      "style": {
        "color": "#color",
        "icon": "svg_path"
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "node1",
      "target": "node2",
      "value": 100,
      "style": {
        "gradient": ["#start", "#end"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Libraries
- D3.js (latest version)
- D3-Sankey plugin for layout calculations

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with SVG and ES6 support
- No IE support required

## Deliverables
1. Single HTML file with complete implementation
2. Sample JSON data file
3. Configurable styling system
4. Interactive click-based navigation
5. Smooth transitions and animations

## Success Criteria
- Displays Sankey diagram based on JSON data
- Implements progressive disclosure interaction
- Supports customizable styling
- Runs without external dependencies
- Matches reference design aesthetic
